**About the Presenter**

Adam Codega has worked in IT for four years as a consultant and then systems administrator before becoming a full-time Mac admin two years ago. At Upserve, a SaaS startup in Providence, RI, he embraces the new Apple IT Model and utilizes MDM, DEP, and VPP to keep his Mac infrastructure running. Like others, he also manages the service desk, IT security, and Wi-Fi, so Adam prefers to let computers do the hard work.
